Scrapes Bulbapedia game walkthroughs for trainer data


A program to scrape through Bulbapedia game walkthroughs for trainer data. (May change in the future)
For use in Jond's pixelmon map creation and a personal project of my own for which I initially made this.
I intend to scrape all the trainer data and place them in a battle simulator and rank the trainers from every game
based on the results and even assign elo to the matches.

The program operation is simple (though the actual contents are a bit more convoluted). Just run the main method and it'll
go through the list of enumerated class games and loads the contents of all the game guides for the enumerated types and
places the contents in a more useable object to that respective object in the guide.

I'll likely incorperate this into a larger project for my elo project for rating the game trainers 
or completely revise it later and use Serebii instead as it is far more complete. (But it appears to be 
more complicated in terms of loading pages compared to how I am here.)

Additionally the project title may change as I later add the storing of items and wild pokemon for instance.
